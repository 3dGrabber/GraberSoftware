			<h2>Technology</h2>

			<p>
			    The IT industry is awash of an overwhelming range of frameworks, programming libraries and languages.
                Many of the technologies that are currently trending, will soon be obsolete.
			    On the other hand, "established" but hopelessly out-dated technology continues to be deployed.

			<h2>Software Architecture</h2>

			<p>
			    The purpose of a software architecture is a solid groundwork for your product.
			    The architecture should lead the way for future developement, without getting in the way by itself.
				This often leads to diffcult choises and design decisions.

	        <h2>Analysis</h2>

	        <p>
	            The growing complexity of software projects can lead to problems.
	            Neccessary extensions become hard or almost impossible to implement
                because existing functionality cannot be jeopardized.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	            We are able to quickly familiarize ourselves even with very complex codebases.

            <h2>Security</h2>

            <p>
                Devices connected to the internet are subject to ample security risks.
                Precautionary measures and cryptographic procedures are needed for secure communication.
                Some of the involved concepts are not easy to grasp. However in our experience it is possible to 
                make them understanable for laymen, which is key for secure operation and maintenance.
                The design of internet connected systems demands delicate trade-offs between security and usability.
